# District Proposals
The district0x Network Token allows holders to signal for new districts to be built by the district0x Team. Prior to the launch of Aragon Core on the MainNet, signaling will be conducted via a custom CarbonVote implementation. The CarbonVote implementation will be manually populated with proposals that have been deemed as 'qualifying'.
## Qualifying Proposals
To be deemed as a 'qualifying proposal' the following conditions must be met:
* The proposal was submitted as an issue in the district0x/district-proposals repository
* The proposed district adheres to the District Proposal Standard template
* The proposed district is not unethical, as defined by the district0x Network Code of Ethics
* The proposed district has obtained quorum
## District Proposal Standard

All proposals should be structured as follows:

**Purpose**: purpose of the proposed district

**Interface**: choose one of the following: List, Thumbnail, Gallery (see Craigslist for examples of each)

**Auxiliary Module Requirements**: functionality needed in addition to d0xINFRA

**Native Token**: does the proposed district need a native token? yes or no. if yes, why

**Implementation Design**: describe how the district should operate in specific detail
